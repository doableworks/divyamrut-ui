            ingrained in the company's DNA and is the fundamental tenet of

              Our first facility, located in the isolated town of Lodsi,
              Uttarakhand, produces cold-pressed oils, Ubtans, and soapsâ€”all
              labor-intensive operations. Being the only factory in the area, it
              has given the locals long-term self-sufficiency and job prospects.
              Since women have historically been prohibited from working in
              certain situations, we are pleased to have helped local women
              become more economically and socially empowered by giving them
              jobs.

              Being an Indian business, we firmly think that our vast youth and
              rural populations have the capacity to be empowered at the
              grassroots level. In light of this, we support the Paathshala
              program because we believe that a child's education is crucial.
              <br /> We launched Paathshala, our "One School-One Village"
              initiative in rural Uttarakhand, in July 2016 in collaboration
              with the Simple Education Foundation (SEF), a non-governmental
              organization based in New Delhi. We currently work in a
              Hindi-medium government high school in the little hamlet of Gular,
              which is situated in the highlands of Tehri Garhwal.
