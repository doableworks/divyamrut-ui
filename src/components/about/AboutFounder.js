        Consultant synergising traditional therapies with her modern medical
        profession to deliver comprehensive health, a much needed approach in
        current times wherein the fast paced life is compelling people to
        suppress symptoms of disease by just depending on modern medicine and
        henceforth neglecting the root cause of it at mental and emotional
        levels.
