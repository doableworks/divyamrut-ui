              In early days of my masters in dental surgery, I came across a
              quote in one of our primary textbooks. It said,{" "}
              <span className="!text-[--voilet] !italic font-semibold">
                “The art of medicine consists of amusing the patient while it is
                the nature that cures the disease”
              </span>
              . I felt curious to understand what was this wise soul trying to
              convey? Who is this nature? Is he quoting the beautiful trees,
              flowers and mountains or does he mean there is some godly figure
              sitting up there that is curing all diseases. Also what it meant
              when he said amusing the patient? why to amuse the patient, what’s
              the importance around making someone smile?{" "}

            <p className="section-content !text-justify">

              In over two decades of my medical practice, this exploration kept
              happening in the background and it kept revealing to me through my
              healing stories that there is a magical healing power inherently
              bestowed by the creator, the nature on each and every individual
              consciousness, and it is indeed in amusement, joy, and happiness,
              and in an healthy state of mind that these power to heal the body
              unleash itself.

          The whole of the existence is full of these magical powers and we
          humans are part of the same existence and have inherited these
          wonderful self healing powers which just needs to be uncovered.

          Self-exploration with a broader perspective by recognising the
          infinitely powerful and wondrous secrets of the existence is the way
          to learn and decode this magical technology of{" "}

          My self-exploration around self healing started with few of my health
          challenges that followed by miraculous recoveries. With blessings of
          Shiva, in presence of my Gurudev and with support of all the
          techniques, therapies and modalities we have brought in Nityanava; I
          healed myself of over 18 gallstones without removing my gallbladder;
          cured my shoulder dislocation with severe frozen shoulder without any
          surgery or medications and reversed a transient raise in my thyroid
          levels in a real short duration. In these few and in many other
          healing experiences,

          Several people who got oriented in this progressive and advanced
          healing technology and are reaping the benefits by recovering not just
          from a physical ailment but taking the healing journey much deeper by
          addressing the source of the disease at the level of the mind and
          working on emotional and spiritual cleansing to achieve holistic
          wellbeing.
