            Well-being is a state of feeling fit and robust at the level of
            body, fresh &nbsp;&amp;&nbsp; unpolluted at the level of the mind.
            Healing happens when you learn to live without carrying any dis-ease
            in the body or trauma in the mind from any happenings of the past.

            In order to achieve a healthy and happy mind-body complex, it is
            primarily important to identify the cause to its depth. There is
            substantial documented evidence to support the philosophy that,{" "}
            <span className="!text-[--voilet] !italic font-semibold">
              ‘it all begins in the mind’
            </span>{" "}
            and therefore the root cause of any dis-ease state at the level of
            thoughts, emotions and body lies primarily in the domain of the
            mind.
          </p>

          <p className="section-content !text-justify !mb-3">
            We at Nityanava strive to look at an individual holistically.

          <p className="section-content !text-justify !mb-3">
            Life expressions account to a combination of bodily challenges,
            individual mindset, emotional state, financial position, social
            circle and the skill of working on your personal growth.

          <p className="section-content !text-justify !mb-3">
            Here we take all the above in consideration to curate a personalised
            well-being plan that heals the areas that need attention in life to
            unveil and blossom the ever-present newness &nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;
            freshness to make learning, growing and exploring life a
