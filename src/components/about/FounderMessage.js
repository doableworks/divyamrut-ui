              In early days of my masters in dental surgery, I came across a
              quote in one of our primary textbooks. It said, “The art of
              medicine consists of amusing the patient while it is the nature
              that cures the disease”. I felt curious to understand what was
              this wise soul trying to convey? Who is this nature? Is he quoting
              the beautiful trees, flowers and mountains or does he mean there
              is some godly figure sitting up there that is curing all diseases.
              Also what it meant when he said amusing the patient? why to amuse
              the patient, what’s the importance around making someone smile?
              What’s the role of entertainment and amusement in treatment. In
              over two decades of my medical practice, this exploration kept
              happening in the background and it kept revealing to me through my
              healing stories that there is a magical healing power inherently
              bestowed by the creator, the nature on each and every individual
              consciousness, and it is indeed in amusement, joy, and happiness,
              and in an healthy state of mind that these power to heal the body
              unleash itself.

            <p className="section-content !text-justify">
              The defence mechanism and the immune system of the body is that
              power. The magical ways of respiratory and cardiac systems to keep
              everything in equilibrium is that power. The strength and
              resilience of our digestive system is that power. The ability of
              the mind to de-clutter itself using the breath is that power.

          The whole of the existence is full of these magical powers and we
          humans are part of the same existence and have inherited these
          wonderful self healing powers which just needs to be uncovered.
          Self-exploration with a broader perspective by recognising the
          infinitely powerful and wondrous secrets of the existence is the way
          to learn and decode this magical technology of consciousness to heal
          thy self.
          <br />
          My self-exploration around self healing started with few of my health
          challenges that followed by miraculous recoveries. With blessings of
          Shiva, in presence of my Guru and with support of all the techniques,
          therapies and modalities we have brought in Nityanava; I healed myself
          of over 18 gallstones without removing my gallbladder; cured my
          shoulder dislocation with severe frozen shoulder without any surgery
          or medications and reversed a transient raise in my thyroid levels in
          a real short duration. In these few and in many other healing
          experiences, I realised… I can heal my life… and if I can, even you
          can heal your life.
          <br />
          Several people who got oriented in this progressive and advanced
          healing technology are reaping the benefits by recovering not just
          from a physical ailment but taking the healing journey much deeper by
          addressing the source of the disease at the level of the mind and
          working on emotional and spiritual cleansing to achieve holistic
          wellbeing.
